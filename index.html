        <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time !</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Adventure isn't just about going places—it's about discovering who you
          are when you're outside your comfort zone. It's about taking the road
          less traveled, breathing in the fresh mountain air, and feeling your
          heart race with every step into the unknown. Whether you're cycling
          through winding trails, soaring through open skies, or riding the
          waves of the ocean, adventure pushes your limits and awakens your
          soul.
          <br /><br />
          These moments—mud-splashed shoes, wind in your face, the echo of your
          own laughter under the stars—become memories that last a lifetime. In
          a world full of routines and noise, adventure is your call to freedom.
          So pack your bags, tighten your laces, and embrace the thrill. Because
          out there, beyond the usual, is a version of you waiting to be
          discovered.

          <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          There's nothing quite like the feeling of riding through wild, untamed
          trails—just you, your bike, and the path ahead. Biking isn’t just
          about speed or distance; it's about connection. Every twist in the
          road, every climb that burns your muscles, and every descent that
          fills your lungs with crisp air tells a story of endurance and thrill.
          <br /><br />
          From misty mountain tracks to sunlit forest paths, each ride becomes a
          new adventure. The rhythm of your pedaling, the dirt flying under your
          tires, and the horizon always just a little farther away—this is where
          freedom lives. When you're on a bike, you're not just exploring
          nature—you’re discovering yourself.

        <div class="bg bg2" id="gliding">
          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Imagine running toward the edge of a cliff—not to fall, but to fly.
          That’s the magic of paragliding. With the earth shrinking beneath you
          and the wind as your guide, you rise above it all. Cities turn into
          specks, mountains into ripples, and worries into dust. It’s not just a
          sport—it’s a spiritual experience.
          <br /><br />
          As you glide gracefully over valleys and peaks, every breath feels
          fresher, every second feels eternal. The sky becomes your playground,
          your canvas, your home. This is where fear transforms into freedom.
          Once you taste the sky, the ground will never be enough.
        </p>

        <div class="bg bg3" id="surfing">
          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          The ocean roars, the wind howls, and your heart races—surfing is not
          just a sport, it’s a symphony of balance, bravery, and rhythm. As you
          rise with the waves, it’s not about fighting nature; it’s about
          becoming one with it. Every wave carries the pulse of the planet, and
          every ride becomes a dance between you and the sea.
          <br /><br />
          Whether you're falling, rising, or riding strong, each moment out
          there teaches resilience. Salt in your hair, sun on your skin, and
          endless blue in your eyes—surfing connects you to something ancient
          and infinite. The ocean becomes both your test and your temple. Dare
          to ride it.
